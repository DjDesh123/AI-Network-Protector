# AI-Based Intrusion Detection System (AI-IDS)

## Overview

This project aims to build an intelligent, machine learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) capable of identifying malicious network behavior in real-time or near-real-time. It is designed to outperform traditional signature-based IDS tools by detecting both known and unknown attacks through behavioral analysis.

---

## Objectives

- Detect malicious traffic using machine learning algorithms.
- Reduce reliance on static rules and known attack signatures.
- Handle zero-day and novel threats using anomaly detection.
- Provide metrics to evaluate detection performance.

---

## Features

- Supervised learning-based detection (Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks, etc.).
- Feature preprocessing and data normalization.
- Model evaluation using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.
- (Optional) Dashboard or report generation for visual analysis.
- Dataset support for CICIDS2017 and NSL-KDD.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, tensorflow/keras (optional)  
- **Datasets:** CICIDS2017, NSL-KDD  
- **(Optional):** Flask for web interface, Wireshark/tcpdump for traffic capture
